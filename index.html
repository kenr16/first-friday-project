            <p class="bg-info">The objectives for the wikipedia clone site are quite simple:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="bg-info">Mimic the layout/design of a profession site.</li>
              <li class="bg-info">Practice using bootstrap elements.</li>
              <li class="bg-info">Set-up bootstrap tabs and searchbar.</li>

          <div class="panel-body hawaiiplace">
            <p>This one one of the first sites that looks very prefessionally done, due to the fact that we attempted to map out what we wanted the layout of the site to look like before we began work on the site.  The end result is quite an early success in attempting to focus on design rather than raw code.</p>

          <div class="panel-body petstore">
            <p>This project was an exercise to create a petstore that would enable us to show off what we know of divs and float functions.  It was also one of the better attempts at using unconventional menu navigation styles, as the floating colored spheres were meant to be menu items.</p>

              Hello there.  I m Ken Rutan, an aspiring web developer studying coding at Epicodus school in Portland, OR.  This is a webpage that serves as a central hub to showcase my recent projects.  Since I am still in my first week of schooling, this site is very new, and not a final demonstration of my abilities.  I will hopefully have time in the upcoming months to add further updates to the site's content and design as I go along.
            </p>
            <p>
              I currently reside in Oregon City with two dogs, Kuro and Cha, both of which are very energetic and loving animals.  I commute into Portland via bus everyday for classes, as the city is usually gridlocked during morning and evening rush hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was born and raised in Fremont, California, which is a small city located on the outskirts of Oakland.

    <h2>Portfolio landing page</h1>
    <h3>Hello, I am Ken Rutan, a current student with Epicodus, this is a first attempt at a portfolio landing page.</h2>
    <p>Portfolio</p>
    <p>Here you will find a list of previous epicodus projects that I have worked on.  While my portfolio is relatively small, it is always growing, and I welcome you to take a look.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/kenr16/wikipedia-clone">Wikipedia Clone</a>
    <p>This is an early attempt to use bootstrap elements to clone the style of the wikipedia landing page.  None of the links are currently functional.</p>
