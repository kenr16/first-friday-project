                Hello there.  I m Ken Rutan, an aspiring web developer studying coding at Epicodus school in Portland, OR.  This is a webpage that serves as a central hub to showcase my recent projects.  Since I am still in my first week of schooling, this site is very new, and not a final demonstration of my abilities.  I will hopefully have time in the upcoming months to add further updates to the site's content and design as I go along.
              </p>
              <p class="descripttext">
                I currently reside in Oregon City with two dogs, Kuro and Cha, both of which are very energetic and loving animals.  While I ony keep dogs as pets, and at one point a temporary chinchilla companion.  The family animal of the Rutans is a pig, hence the emblem above.  All of the cool animals (fox, wolf, hawk, eagle, shark) were taken already, apparently.  I commute into Portland via bus everyday for classes, as the city is usually gridlocked during morning and evening rush hours.
              </p>
              <p class="descripttext">
                I enjoy the Portland nightlife, and have listed many of my favorite restraunts on my private blog.  I am always on the hunt for a great bacon cheeseburger and a vanilla milkshake to wash it down.

                I am a dockworker by trade.  After many long years and very early morning starts, I decided that it was time to make a move towards changing careers.  After looking at several bootcamps, many of them in the Portland area, I settles on Epicodus, both for it's longer courses, more in-class hours and it's cheaper tuition relative to other courses.  I had previously spent some time online learning to code in couple of languages on self-teaching websites.
